##Description
An introduction to validation with CSS. CSS validation allows you to make fields red or green based on their value. There are a few bugs with this property - for instance, all you need to do to validate an email address is add the @ symbol. However, it is a nice addition to forms.

##How To Run
In your terminal, run command ```http-server -p 4040```.

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
